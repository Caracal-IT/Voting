The app will require two screens:
1. Voting screen
2. Results screen
While voting is happening, the Voting screen must display a button for each item being voted on. 
Once a winner has been determined, the voting screen must just show the winner. 
Users can only vote for a pair once.
The results screen must display the same pair as the voting screen with a tally of the current 
votes as well as a button for the presenter to progress voting to the next pair.

1. Install NodeJS and NPM on you machine if it is not installed.

5. Compile and run the application.
